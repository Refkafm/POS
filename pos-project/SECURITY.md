# Security Guide for POS System

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the POS system and provides guidelines for secure deployment and maintenance.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Environment Configuration
- ✅ Environment variables for all sensitive configuration
- ✅ Separate configuration files for different environments
- ✅ Validation of required environment variables
- ✅ Protection against default secrets in production

### 2. Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- ✅ Secure password hashing with bcrypt (12 rounds)
- ✅ Role-based access control (Admin, Manager, Cashier)
- ✅ Session management with secure cookies

### 3. Input Validation & Sanitization
- ✅ Request sanitization middleware
- ✅ Input validation for all API endpoints
- ✅ XSS protection through content sanitization
- ✅ SQL injection prevention (NoSQL injection for MongoDB)

### 4. Rate Limiting
- ✅ General API rate limiting (100 requests per 15 minutes)
- ✅ Strict authentication rate limiting (5 attempts per 15 minutes)
- ✅ Endpoint-specific rate limiting

### 5. Security Headers
- ✅ Helmet.js for security headers
- ✅ Content Security Policy (CSP)
- ✅ HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)
- ✅ X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, etc.

### 6. CORS Configuration
- ✅ Configurable CORS origins
- ✅ Credential support with proper origin validation
- ✅ Method and header restrictions

### 7. Logging & Monitoring
- ✅ Structured logging with Winston
- ✅ Sensitive data filtering in logs
- ✅ Security event logging
- ✅ Request/response logging
- ✅ Error tracking and monitoring

### 8. File Upload Security
- ✅ File type validation
- ✅ File size limits
- ✅ Secure file storage
- ✅ Malicious file detection

## Production Deployment Checklist

### Environment Setup
- [ ] Generate strong, unique secrets for JWT_SECRET, JWT_REFRESH_SECRET, and SESSION_SECRET
- [ ] Set NODE_ENV=production
- [ ] Configure proper MongoDB connection string
- [ ] Set up SSL/TLS certificates
- [ ] Configure proper CORS origins for production domains
- [ ] Set secure cookie settings (secure: true, sameSite: 'strict')

### Infrastructure Security
- [ ] Use HTTPS only (redirect HTTP to HTTPS)
- [ ] Set up firewall rules (only allow necessary ports)
- [ ] Configure reverse proxy (Nginx/Apache) with security headers
- [ ] Enable fail2ban or similar intrusion prevention
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Configure automated backups

### Database Security
- [ ] Use MongoDB authentication
- [ ] Create dedicated database user with minimal privileges
- [ ] Enable MongoDB encryption at rest
- [ ] Configure MongoDB network security
- [ ] Regular database backups with encryption

### Application Security
- [ ] Run security audit: `npm audit`
- [ ] Update all dependencies to latest secure versions
- [ ] Remove development dependencies from production
- [ ] Set up Content Security Policy headers
- [ ] Configure proper error handling (don't expose stack traces)

### Monitoring & Logging
- [ ] Set up centralized logging (ELK stack, Splunk, etc.)
- [ ] Configure log rotation and retention policies
- [ ] Set up security monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Monitor for suspicious activities
- [ ] Regular security log reviews

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. **Never commit secrets** to version control
2. **Validate all inputs** on both client and server side
3. **Use parameterized queries** to prevent injection attacks
4. **Implement proper error handling** without exposing sensitive information
5. **Keep dependencies updated** and monitor for vulnerabilities
6. **Use HTTPS everywhere** in production
7. **Implement proper session management**
8. **Log security events** for monitoring and forensics

### For System Administrators
1. **Regular security updates** for OS and software
2. **Network segmentation** and firewall configuration
3. **Regular backups** with encryption
4. **Monitor system logs** for suspicious activities
5. **Implement intrusion detection systems**
6. **Regular security assessments** and penetration testing
7. **Access control** and privilege management
8. **Incident response plan** preparation

## Environment Variables Reference

### Required Variables
```bash
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/pos_system
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your-super-secret-refresh-key
SESSION_SECRET=your-super-secret-session-key
```

### Optional Variables
```bash
PORT=3001
NODE_ENV=production
BCRYPT_ROUNDS=12
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=900000
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=100
CORS_ORIGIN=https://yourdomain.com
LOG_LEVEL=info
```

## Security Incident Response

### In Case of Security Breach
1. **Immediately isolate** affected systems
2. **Change all secrets** (JWT secrets, database passwords, etc.)
3. **Revoke all active sessions** and tokens
4. **Analyze logs** to understand the scope of the breach
5. **Notify stakeholders** according to your incident response plan
6. **Document the incident** and lessons learned
7. **Implement additional security measures** to prevent recurrence

## Regular Security Maintenance

### Weekly
- [ ] Review security logs for anomalies
- [ ] Check for dependency updates with security fixes
- [ ] Monitor system performance and unusual activities

### Monthly
- [ ] Run comprehensive security scans
- [ ] Review and rotate API keys if necessary
- [ ] Update security documentation
- [ ] Test backup and recovery procedures

### Quarterly
- [ ] Conduct security assessment
- [ ] Review and update security policies
- [ ] Security training for development team
- [ ] Penetration testing (if applicable)

## Compliance Considerations

### PCI DSS (if handling credit cards)
- Implement additional encryption for payment data
- Regular security assessments
- Network segmentation for payment processing
- Secure key management

### GDPR (if handling EU customer data)
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Right to be forgotten implementation
- Data breach notification procedures
- Privacy by design principles
